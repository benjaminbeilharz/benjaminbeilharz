âœ¨News: I have been accepted for an exchange semester this fall at National Taiwan University and have been selected to participate in @ASWF summer learning program ğŸ¥³  

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics from Heidelberg University and currently pursue a Master's degree in Visual Computing at Technical University of Darmstadt. 

I was a ğŸ¤— Student Ambassador for TU Darmstadt and Heidelberg University. 
Currently, I work for the Deutsche Bahn AG (German Railway company) as a Machine Learning Engineer
and have worked for three years at SAP as a UX in-house consultant during my studies.

After a degree in NLP, I am now mainly working on extending the fundaments and learning about computer graphics.

I am primarily interested in:
- Physical-based Rendering (offline + RT)
- Inverse Rendering
- Material Appearance Modeling (BxDF)
- Computer Vision
- GPGPU
