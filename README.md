**He/They**::BA Computational Linguistics@Heidelberg University. MSc Cognitive Science@Technical University Darmstadt

I am currently a 🤗 Student Ambassador for TU Darmstadt and Heidelberg University. If you happen to be interested in learning more about the 🤗 ecosystem , need a demo or a tutorial, hit me up via ✉️ or Discord (gdaythisisben#5902).

My research interests can be found at the intersection of Machine Learning and Cognitive Science, where I am particularly interested in:
- Cognition:
  - How do we humans plan an activity and approach their goal?
  - How do we learn concepts and be able to abstract these to take on new tasks?
  - How can we learn a model of the world?
  - Reverse engineering the mind
- Common Sense:
  - How can we leverage multiple senses to create the dark matter of knowledge (implicit knowledge and behaviour)?
  - Social learning, i.e. morals, ethics and game theory
- Creativity:
  - How can a machine assist in creative and artistic tasks?
- Machine Learning:
  - Multimodal Machine Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning, e.g. (cooperative) multi-agent, hierarchical, and model based
  - Bayesian/Probabilistic Machine Learning

我也會說中文（也會看都繁體或簡體中文）。

不好意思，目前我覺得這個段做不完。我請你等一下，我真的想繼續寫，但是現在我沒有時間。
