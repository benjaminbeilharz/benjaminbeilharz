G'day this is Ben!  

Some facts about me:  
- before studying computer graphics and (human) vision, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics focusing on social/moral commonsense knowledge induced large language models, but when
- Avatar 2 is the reason I decided to switch to the field of computer graphics and ultimately want to pursue a career in graphics/VFX,
- this is how I discovered the Academy Software Foundation and became a part of their Summer Learning Program where I learned more about production rendering, PBR, look development, lighting, and standards like MaterialX, and USD among many others.
- Literate programming should be more mainstream and LISP is one of the most beautiful languages to exist on this planet (even though many argue its extraterrestrial existence).
- I love all things creativity: photography, sketching and painting, setting up nice lighting rigs in Katana and Houdini, making materials pop.

Some of my research interests:
- Physically-based rendering, in production as well as in research settings (where I am more or less interested in inverse rendering),
- neural graphics, i.e. how we can use deep learning to amplify the visual quality and reduce overall computational complexity (how can we support artists and save one tree at a time),
- material appearance modeling (because I want to make them pop),
- systems and parallel programming (because efficiency is key),
- and a profound interest in how we perceive our wonderful world.
