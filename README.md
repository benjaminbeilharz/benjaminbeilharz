G'day this is Ben!  

Some facts about me:  
- before studying computer graphics and (human) vision, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics focusing on social/moral commonsense knowledge induced large language models
- I have been elected to be part of the Academy Software Foundation's Summer Learning Program and be among Hugging Face's first student ambassadors
- literate programming should be more mainstream.
- and I have a worrisome tendency to learn new (programming) languages.

Nowadays I am primarily interested in the following:
- Physically-based (inverse) rendering
- Material appearance modeling
- Deep Learning for CG
- gpgpu, systems programming, compilers and languages
- and Vision Science


ğŸ’¬ Languages I'm speaking and learning: ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ
