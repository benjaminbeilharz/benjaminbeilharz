**He/They**::BA Computational Linguistics@Heidelberg University. MSc Cognitive Science@Technical University Darmstadt

My research interests can be found at the intersection of Machine Learning and Cognitive Science, where I am particularly interested in:
- AI for Social Good
- Human-Machine Collaboration (interactive systems)
- Reinforcement Learning (multi-agent, etc.)
- Game Theory
- Decision Making
- Perception
- Emotion and Creativity
- Commonsense Knowledge and Reasoning
- Emodied AI


我也會說中文（也會看都繁體或簡體中文）。

_(this is a whole wip)_  
不好意思，目前我覺得這個段做不完。我請你等一下，我真的想繼續寫，但是現在我沒有時間。

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- the JAX stack
- C++
- how to write a custom cuda extension for PyTorch
- how to create decision-making environments in game engines for multi-agent reinforcement learning
