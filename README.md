**He/They**::BA Computational Linguistics@Heidelberg University. MSc Cognitive Science@Technical University Darmstadt

I am currently a 🤗 Student Ambassador for TU Darmstadt and Heidelberg University. If you happen to be interested in learning more about the 🤗 ecosystem , need a demo or a tutorial, hit me up via ✉️ or Discord (gdaythisisben#5902).

My research interests can be found at the intersection of Machine Learning and Cognitive Science, where I am particularly interested in:
- AI for Social Good & Health
- (Moral & Social) Commonsense Knowledge and Reasoning
- Affective/Physiological Computing
- Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning
- (On-Device Learning)

Apart from research I am also interested in:
- Development for Apple's platforms
- Data Viz
- Illustration and new experiences via code

我也會說中文（也會看都繁體或簡體中文）。

_(this is a whole wip)_  
不好意思，目前我覺得這個段做不完。我請你等一下，我真的想繼續寫，但是現在我沒有時間。

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- the JAX stack
- Training on constrained computational resources, i.e. mobile devices
- Signal Processing & Signal Detection Theory

💬 Languages I'm speaking and/or learning: 🇩🇪 🇬🇧 🇨🇳 🇹🇼 🇪🇸 / 🇮🇹
