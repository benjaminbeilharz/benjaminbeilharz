**He/They**::BA Computational Linguistics@Heidelberg University. MSc Cognitive Science@Technical University Darmstadt

I am currently a 🤗 Student Ambassador for TU Darmstadt and Heidelberg University. If you happen to be interested in learning more about the 🤗 ecosystem , need a demo or a tutorial, hit me up via ✉️ or Discord (gdaythisisben#5902).

My research interests can be found at the intersection of Machine Learning and Cognitive Science, where I am particularly interested in:

- Alignment:
  - Aligning AI systems to human intent and in accordance with human values (RLHF!)
  - Human-AI Collaboration
  - Multi-Agent Systems and Game Theory
- Cognition:
  - How do we as humans learn concepts and be able to apply them to new situations?
  - Perception grounded language
- Commonsense:
  - Social, Moral and Physical Commonsense Reasoning
  - Biases and Social Inequality
- Machine Learning:
  - Multimodal Machine Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
  - Bayesian/Probabilistic Machine Learning

我也會說中文（也會看都繁體或簡體中文）。

_(this is a whole wip)_  
不好意思，目前我覺得這個段做不完。我請你等一下，我真的想繼續寫，但是現在我沒有時間。

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- the JAX stack
- Computer vision from scratch

💬 Languages I'm speaking and/or learning: 🇩🇪 🇬🇧 🇨🇳 🇹🇼 🇪🇸
