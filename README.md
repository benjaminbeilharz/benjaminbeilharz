âœ¨News: I have been accepted for an exchange semester this fall at National Taiwan University and have been selected to participate in the ASWF's summer learning program ğŸ¥³  

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computational Linguistics from Heidelberg University and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Visual Computing at the Technical University of Darmstadt. 

I was a ğŸ¤— Student Ambassador for TU Darmstadt and Heidelberg University. 
I work for the Deutsche Bahn AG (German Railways company) as a Machine Learning Engineer
and have worked for three years at SAP as a UX in-house consultant during my studies.

After a degree in NLP, I am mainly working on extending the fundamentals and learning about computer graphics.

I am primarily interested in:
- Physical-based Rendering (offline + RT)
- Inverse Rendering
- Computer Vision (for 3D)
- GPGPU


ğŸ’¬ Languages I'm speaking and learning: ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³ ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼ ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸
