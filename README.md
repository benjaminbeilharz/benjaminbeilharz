**He/They**::NLP student turned to UX Intern currently working at SAP to learn more about human-centered technology.  
  
I am interested in emotional intelligence and creativity in neural networks. Occasionally I like story-yelling with visualizations; I enjoy the intersection where machine learning and contemporary art come together and all things computational art and design.
我也會說中文（也會看都繁體或簡體中文）。

_(this is a whole wip)_  
不好意思，目前我覺得這個段做不完。我請你等一下，我真的想繼續寫，但是現在我沒有時間。

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the JAX stack and 🤗 . It seems as it gives me the opportunity to learn more about the underlying principles (also faster computation saves energy right?) 🎉
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my bachelor thesis which will be an investigation on how neural networks are capable of learning empathy from social-interaction and moral commonsense and express it in a dialogue setting, while being capable of looking forward or backward in the conversation history.
