**He/Him**::BA Computational Linguistics@Heidelberg University. MSc Cognitive Science@Technical University Darmstadt

✨News: I have been accepted for an exchange semester this fall at National Taiwan University 🥳

I was a 🤗 Student Ambassador for TU Darmstadt and Heidelberg University. If you still happen to be interested in learning more about the 🤗 ecosystem , need a demo or a tutorial, hit me up via ✉️ or Discord (gdaythisisben#5902).

After a degree in NLP I am now mainly working on extending the fundaments and learning about visual systems.
Therefore I am currently taking courses on *human perception, computer graphics and computer vision* to dive deeper into the field of rendering and all its fields.

我也會說中文（也會看都繁體或簡體中文）。

_(this is a whole wip)_  
不好意思，目前我覺得這個段做不完。我請你等一下，我真的想繼續寫，但是現在我沒有時間。

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Computer Vision
- the GPU Pipeline
- C++

💬 Languages I'm speaking and/or learning: 🇩🇪 🇬🇧 🇨🇳 🇹🇼 🇪🇸
