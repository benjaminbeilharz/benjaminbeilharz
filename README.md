**He/They**::Data Science enabled UX Intern currently working at SAP  
and writing my Bachelor Thesis in Computational Linguistics at Heidelberg University.  
I am interested in story-yelling with data visualizations; AI×Media art, generative art, and computational design.  
我也會說中文（也會看都繁體或簡體中文）。

_(this is a whole wip)_  
不好意思，目前我覺得這個段做不完。我請你等一下，我真的想繼續寫，但是現在我沒有時間。
