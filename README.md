**He/They**::Computational Linguistics undergrad at Heidelberg University, currently writing his thesis with Prof. Anette Frank advising me. The title of my thesis is: *Be Constructive, Helpful and Empathetic: Towards Situated Empathic Dialogue Generation Grounded in Social and Moral Commonsense Knowledge*

My research interests can be found at the intersection of Language/Speech and Cognitive Science, where I am particularly interested in:
- AI for Social Good
- Commonsense Reasoning
- Speech Recognition
- Natural Language Generation
- Transfer Learning
- Machine Cognition

我也會說中文（也會看都繁體或簡體中文）。

_(this is a whole wip)_  
不好意思，目前我覺得這個段做不完。我請你等一下，我真的想繼續寫，但是現在我沒有時間。

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the JAX stack, 🤗 ecosystem and Rust-Python FFI
- 🔭 I’m currently working on my bachelor thesis which will be an investigation on how neural networks are capable of speaking empathetically, grounded in moral and norm commonsense and express it in a dialogue setting
